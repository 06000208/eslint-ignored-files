# eslint issue 1086

A repository intended to replicate an issue with formatting files in the [dbaeumer.vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) vs code extension.

I am assuming this to be related to [issue #1086](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-eslint/issues/1086), as it's the same error message, but this may be mistaken/the wrong call.
